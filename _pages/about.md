I'am currently a graduated student in [Beijing International Center for Mathematical Research(BICMR)](https://bicmr.pku.edu.cn/), Peking University.

And I am advised by [advisvor's name](https://www.google.com.hk/), studying in ...

## Interests

**Mathematical Physics**: I am mostly interested in ...; I am also interested in geometric formulation of thoeries of physics -- though I am not quite good at physics.

Most of my leisure time is spent on bed or in the chair: sleeping, gaming, and sometimes writing (or typing, considering that I write with a computer). Most things I wrote are notes on math and a few of them are fictions. They are posted on my blog (some of them are in Chinese). As for games, I prefer indie games with any of following ingredients: story-rich, puzzles, atmospheric, anti-utopia, and meta - for example, *Rusty Lake* series, *Superliminal*, *Not for Broadcast* and *MiSide*(not played yet). I also enjoy some AAA games like *Metro* series, *Resident Evil VI*.

Watching film is also my hobby. Unfortunately, I remember few films that I have watched, due to not having the habit of writing film reviews.
